"""
This module create 2 graphs. 

The count_graph variable have a dict that represents
for each key the number of other nodes that this node
have depencies

The relational_graph is another dict that represents the
actual graph, each node is a python object id (see id 
built-in function) and have edges to others objects.

Finally, the module have a cache system. For every node the response
if filled into the cache to don't waste time processing this again.
This feature implies that all functions need to be stateless/thread-safe.

Another importante issue with that method is recursive functions.
Seen that we make the function be lazy. A recursive function will
be represented by just one node. That is not a problem when we are
talking about recursive lazy calls, but if we start a topological sorting
algorithm without know all nodes that makes the graph this maybe will create a issue.

The idea of the module is construct a DAG graph that will be used into the topological
sorting algorithm to process some tasks in a processing pool.
